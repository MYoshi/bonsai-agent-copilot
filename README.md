# 🌳 Bonsai Cutting Game

Welcome to the **Bonsai Cutting Game**! ✂️🌱

This project was created fully using GitHub Copilot, utilizing Copilot's Agent feature for autonomous, multi-step code generation and project setup.

## 🎮 How to Play

Grow and care for your digital bonsai! New healthy leaves appear, but beware: bad leaves will show up and you must cut them before your bonsai gets sick! Configure the game to your liking and see if you can grow the healthiest bonsai in record time.

- **Healthy leaves** 🌿 appear every few seconds (configurable!)
- **Bad leaves** 🍂 appear and must be cut by clicking them
- **Win** 🏆 by growing enough healthy leaves with no bad ones
- **Lose** 💀 if too many bad leaves take over

## ⚙️ Game Configuration

You can change these options right in the app:
- ⏱️ Seconds for a healthy leaf to appear

## 💡 Prompts Used

This project was built step-by-step using the following prompts:

1. I want to make a page where i can cut my bonsai. The time will be passing and I need to cut the bad parts.
2. React and Next.js.
3. Seems like there is an error
4. You forgot the use client on the top of the files.
5. Can you make the Bonsai more veautiful?
6. Can you make the bonsai leafs to be more life a leaf?
7. Now we only have 5 leaves. How many you can make?
8. The tree is small, maybe make slightly bigger? It still needs to fit a mobile screen.
9. Can you make those leaves better?
10. Can you make the leaves only a circle back again?
11. Not overlapping circle, each leaf is one circle.
12. Now make the circle more leaf format.
13. More detailed and pointed
14. Leaf shape and bigger
15. Can you update the README that this is created fully using GitHub Copilot?
16. Explain that it is using Agent
17. Can you type of the readm all the prompts?
18. Now I want to change the game to have a win condition. For every 10 seconds a new leaf is added. And if you reach 30 green leaves you are a winner.
19. Now I need that the time for a leaf to turn red is 2 times slower than a new leaf to appear.
20. What is the fastest time for someone to win the game?
21. Let's reduce that time. Let's make leaf turn red every 15 seconds.
22. How long it takes for the fastest time to win?
23. Let's reduce both times, from 10 seconds to 5 and from 15 seconds to 7 seconds.
24. Let's reduce 5 to 1 and 7 to 3.
25. Every bad one if stays for 1 second, it will turn a green one into red. If you get 10 red you lose.
26. The game is not working now. I can't see new green or red leaves
27. Now everytime a new red shows it turns all greens into red. That is wrong. The red after 1 second should turn only one green, not all.
28. When a red shows it is turning all green into red. That is wrong.
29. Remove the logic that makes the green turn into red.
30. Now just show red leaves every 1 second.
31. Now make the healthy one turn into red every 2 seconds.
32. If a leaf is behind another one, I cannot click. So make the red ones always to the front.
33. If you have 30 healthy leaves you win only if you have 0 red ones.
34. I want to be able to configured the options of the game in the screen:
I have: 
Number of seconds a Healthy Leaf appears.
Number of seconds a Bad Leaf appears.
I have the number of health leaves to win.
I have the number of bad leaves to lose.
Please give me a way to change those options in the browser. 
35. I want to see the number of bad leaves as well on the top together with the Healthy leaves
36. Can I see the default option as well on the form to change the configurations?
37. Can you change the number of Healthy Leaves to show to 1 second?
38. I cannot edit the configuration.
39. I still cannot change the options.
40. The font on the inputs, change to green.
41. The message when you lose or win needs to update based on the config
42. Add the .gitignore
43. Create a new repository on github
44. Add all the prompts to the README

Enjoy your bonsai adventure! 🌳✨
